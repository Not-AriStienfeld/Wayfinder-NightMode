# Wayfinder

A pixel precise rebuild of the Apple Watch Ultra Wayfinder watchface. All assets are manually precisely redrawn.




## What it can do / running complications

 - Compass smoothly rotating 
 - GPS coordinates in center ring including last refresh time
 - Activity rings
 - Date and weekday
 - Oxygen Saturation (SpO2)
 - Altimeter / Altitude
 - Battery level
 - Distance walked of today
 - Actual BPM with range indicator for lowest and highest

## What do not work

 - Green dots for cellular signal strength since this data is noch available for me



## Installation

#### Xcode

Run project in Xcode and compile.

#### Sideloadly

Download https://sideloadly.io/ and the .ipa file in repository root. Make sure you choose "normal install" in Sideloadly. With "Apple-ID Sideloading" the watchOS app will not occur.
